# HappinessReport
Thorough analysis of a data set from the World Happiness Report

Which factors are more important to live a happier life? As a result, people and countries can focus on the more significant factors to achieve a higher happiness level

We tried to answer this question by:
- cleaning data;
- understanding the meaning of outliers;
- analysing it geographically;
- difference between years;
- understanding correlations;
- comparing South America with Europe.

Is money everything?
